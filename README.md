# Unity - Bluetooh - Arduino

This is an improvement from [this project](https://github.com/iqfareez/Unity-Serial-Arduino) I made a while ago. 

Control simple Unity game using analog joystick over Bluetooth connection using Arduino.

It is also **possible** to do wired connection between Arduino and PC. Doesn't necessarily require bluetooth.

## Getting started

This project is made up of two parts; **Arduino** & **Unity**.

Each part has its README file with instructions to set the project up. So, kindly refer to:

- Arduino ([Arduino](/Arduino/))
- Unity ([Pew Pew](/Pew%20Pew/))
